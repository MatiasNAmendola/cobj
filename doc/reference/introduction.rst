CObj is a general purpose, object-oriented DSL language.

Rules:

- Everything is object.
- Interaction happens between objects.
- Definitional binding and rebinding

Program Structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In this section, we describe the abstract syntactic and semantic structucr of CObj.

- At the topmost level, a CObj is a module, which is called 'main'. main module can consists of a set of modules.
- A module consits of objects (module is object too). We use names to refer them, and use operaters to operate them, and control structure to control them.
