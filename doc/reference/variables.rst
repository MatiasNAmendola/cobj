Variables
---------

Variables are places that store values (All values in CO are objects).

There are two kinds of variables: global variables, local variables.

A single name can denote a global variable or a local variable (function's formal parameter, which is a particular kind of local variable).

Any variable name is assumed to be global unless explicitly declared as local. Local variables are lexically scoped: local variables can be freely accessed by functions defined inside their scope.

Before the first assignment to a variable, its value is None.
