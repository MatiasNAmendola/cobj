Naming and defining
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A `scope` is the context within a computer program in which a name is valid and can be used to refer its object. Outsider the scope of a name, the name's object may still be stored, and may even be accessible in some way, but the name does not refer to it; that is the name is not bound to the variable's storage.
