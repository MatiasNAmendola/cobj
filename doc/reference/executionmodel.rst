Execution Model

Naming and defining
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A `scope` is the context within a computer program in which a name is valid and can be used to refer its object. Outsider the scope of a name, the name's object may still be stored, and may even be accessible in some way, but the name does not refer to it; that is the name is not bound to the variable's storage.

CObject is lexically scoped using blocks:

#. The scope of an identifier denoting a constant, variable, or function
#


Exceptions
~~~~~~~~~~
Exceptions are a means of breaking out of the normal flow of control of a code block in order to handle errors or other exceptional conditions. An exception is raised at the point where the error is detected; it may be handled by the surrounding code block or by any code block that directly or indirectly invoked the code block where the error occurred.
