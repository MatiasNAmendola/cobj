Scoping Rules
-------------

A `scope` is the context within a computer program in which a name is valid and can be used to refer its object. Outsider the scope of a name, the name's object may still be stored, and may even be accessible in some way, but the name does not refer to it; that is the name is not bound to the variable's storage.

CObject is lexically scoped using blocks:

#. The scope of an identifier denoting a constant, variable, or function
