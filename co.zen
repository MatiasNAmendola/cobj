The Zen of CO

Everything is object.
Interaction happens between objects.
So, three is enough, don't do more.

Exporing world is long, long term, be patient.
Language describes things, although you must know first, but it helps you.
At least, it shouldn't disturb you.

If it's true, it should be truth always!
